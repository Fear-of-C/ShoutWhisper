    ShoutWhisper monitors and downloads content from Facebook posts, tweets and RSS entries from sources that you specify.  It may download the full text of articles and/or some of the attached images.  ShoutWhisper will store up to 500 messages per query and an additional 500 per user.  Facebook posts and Tweets are considered private and will not be routed to other users.  Content dervied from RSS feeds is considered public and may appear in other usersâ€™ feeds.
