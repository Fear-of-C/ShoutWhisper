There's always been a shortage of storytelling in games, and in recent years, many developers have been working on bringing serious drama into gaming.  We're not.
</p><p>
We want to make you laugh--we want you to be frustrated when you to reach your goals while immersing yourself in all the pettiness, distractions and gaffes that make up the texture of meaningful--or not so meaningful--storytelling.  We want you to live and thrive within the world of the story, but never achieve--or at least not feel that you need to do so.  We don't believe that characters reveal the plot but that plot, and all its winding and unnavigable dirt roads, reveals character.
</p><p>
We want an experience for those who aren't afraid to mess up, for those who laugh at themselves and at what others would superficially call their failures; for those who play Hearts until 2 A.M. instead of studying for their chemistry exam and for those who see a little bit of themselves in their best friend's flaws.  Bart is more than just a storyteller: it's a companion for all the George Costanzas, Liz Lemons, Steve Urkels and Lisa Simpsons; names and faces you'd have sooner expected to see on a cocktail menu than in a single lonely game amongst a sea of physiologically-impossible Ubermensches and their even lamer "parodies."  This is for you and the rest of us.  
</p><p>
So don't do your homework, don't do 150 pull-ups at the gym, don't eat that no-carbs salad you said you'd have for dinner; heck, get yourself a couple of drinks as long as you're here; and have fun.
